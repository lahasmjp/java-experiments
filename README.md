These are a collection of small projects I worked on just to play around in Java. In this readMe, I'll list and describe what they're supposed to be.

<h3>TerminalAnimation</h3>
A project made to play around with a form of Thread.sleep(), and the System.in.print() method to animate text similarly to an RPG. I hadn't used sleep methods like this before, but having done some robotics in middle school, I found the method familiar and satisfying to use. Extremely useful.

<h3>VinylCollection</h3>
A project still being worked on that allows the user to view and edit a list of vinyl Record objects that can import/export into a file chosen by the user. I'm not at this stage yet, but I'd also like to add settings to customize both the location a user specifies to save data, and adding/deleting the data fields that can be stored in a Record object (say the user wants to specify the quantity of duplicates they have of that album, or doesn't want to specify the value of every record they have).
